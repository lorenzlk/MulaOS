### 🚀 Recommended Strategy: 3-Phase Rollout

**Phase 1: Foundation (Dec 9-15)** 🔴
- Focus: **NFL only** (simplest execution, highest traffic)
- Effort: 2-4 hours setup + 1 week targeting config
- Target: Playoff contenders (10-12 teams)
- Success: Baseline CTR established

**Phase 2: Expansion (Late Dec / Early Jan)** 🟡
- Add: College Football (4 CFP teams) + NBA (top 10 teams)
- Optimize: Refine NFL based on actual data

**Phase 3: Full Rollout (Feb 2026)** 🟢
- Add: MLB, Tennis, Tier 2/3 sports
- Focus: Scale + contextual optimization

### ⚠️ Critical Gaps

**🔴 Priority 1**: URL pattern discovery (need crawler OR manual inspection)
**🟡 Priority 2**: Traffic data (request analytics OR use estimates)
**🟢 Priority 3**: Health check tool (manual works for now)
**🟢 Priority 4**: ESPN API (automate sports calendar in future)

---

### 📋 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

**1. Stakeholder Decision**
- Does EssentiallySports have contract/budget?
- Do we have publisher contact?
- Commit to Phase 1 timing?

**2. Technical Validation**
- Run `/onboard` manually to confirm results
- Inspect 5-10 pages per sport (NFL, NBA, CFB)
- Document URL patterns

**3. Deployment Approval**
- Choose timing: Dec 9-15 (recommended)
- Confirm engineering capacity
- Lock Phase 1 scope (NFL only)
