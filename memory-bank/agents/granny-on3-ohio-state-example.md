### 30-Day Revenue Forecast

**With Granny Context-Aware Optimization**:
```yaml
week_nov_25_dec_1: # RIVALRY WEEK
  baseline_revenue: "$450"
  contextual_feed: "Beat Michigan rivalry gear"
  lift: "2.3x"
  total_revenue: "$7,200"
  incremental: "+$6,750" ✅

week_dec_2_8: # BIG TEN CHAMPIONSHIP WEEK
  baseline_revenue: "$450"
  contextual_feed: "Big Ten Championship gear"
  lift: "2.0x"
  total_revenue: "$5,400"
  incremental: "+$4,950" ✅

week_dec_9_15: # NORMAL WEEK
  baseline_revenue: "$450"
  contextual_feed: "Ohio State Buckeyes Football"
  lift: "1.0x"
  total_revenue: "$450"
  incremental: "$0"

week_dec_16_22: # NORMAL WEEK
  baseline_revenue: "$450"
  contextual_feed: "Ohio State holiday gift guide"
  lift: "1.2x" # Holiday shopping

  incremental: "+$90"

30_day_total: "$13,590"
